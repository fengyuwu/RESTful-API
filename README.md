Getting Started
---------------

This project implemented a.NET API that exposes endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data from various sources. The API will read and merge data, calculate aggregations, and return summarized information in JSON format.  To test the Apis, clone the whole repo, unzip, and open it in Visual Studio.
Endpoints can be tested using Postman or localhost server when running the project in Visual Studio 2022


Task 1 and Task 3 Endpoints:

https://localhost:7214/top-customers
https://localhost:7214/product-summary
https://localhost:7214/customer-summary
https://localhost:7214/customers
https://localhost:7214/orders
https://localhost:7214/products
https://localhost:7214/order-items



Endpoint exposed to demonstrate the correctness for task 2 only(To be deleted after demo):
https://localhost:7214/demo2-1
https://localhost:7214/demo2-2
https://localhost:7214/demo2-3
https://localhost:7214/demo2-4
https://localhost:7214/demo2-5
https://localhost:7214/demo2-6





Note: Ensure the CSV and JSON files are not opened by other programs when running the web app.
