This project implemented a.NET API that exposes endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data from various sources. The API will read and merge data, calculate aggregations, and return summarized information in JSON format.  

Testing
---------------
1. Visit https://github.com/fengyuwu/RESTful-API
2. Locate  and click the <>Code button on the top right section
3. Navigate to the HTTP tab, and copy URL to clipboard
4. Open Visual Studio 2022 (install .Net 6.0 first)
5. On the Getter Started menu, Select Clone a repository
6. Paste the URL to the repository location input box
7. Select a desired path and hit Clone Button
8. Once the project is loaded, click play button and test the following end point in Local host or postman software.


, unzip, and open it in Visual Studio.
Endpoints can be tested using Postman or localhost server when running the project in Visual Studio 2022


Task 1 and Task 3 Endpoints:

https://localhost:7214/top-customers

https://localhost:7214/product-summary

https://localhost:7214/customer-summary

https://localhost:7214/customers

https://localhost:7214/orders

https://localhost:7214/products

https://localhost:7214/order-items



Endpoint exposed to demonstrate the correctness for task 2 only(To be deleted after demo):
https://localhost:7214/demo2-1

https://localhost:7214/demo2-2

https://localhost:7214/demo2-3

https://localhost:7214/demo2-4

https://localhost:7214/demo2-5

https://localhost:7214/demo2-6





Note: Ensure the CSV and JSON files are not opened by other programs when running the web app.


Testing
-------

Firstly, Install Visual Studio 2022, then run the web app. Finally, download the Postman testing tool to test the API endpoint or use local host.
